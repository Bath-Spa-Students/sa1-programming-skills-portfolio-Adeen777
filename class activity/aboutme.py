#poem no:1
print("""In twilight's glow, the shadows play,
Whispers of night chase dreams away.
Stars blink softly, secrets to share,
In the quiet, we breathe the air.

Time slows down, a gentle sigh,
As the world drifts beneath the sky.
Embrace the moment, let it be,
A fleeting dance of you and me.""")
#poem no:2
print("""Beneath the leaves, a breeze will weave,
Stories of night that hearts believe.
Moonlight spills on paths unknown,
In this magic, we’re never alone.

The world may fade, but here we stand,
Hand in hand, through dreams unplanned.
With every whisper, every glance,
Life’s a fleeting, beautiful dance.""")
#poem no:3
print("""In morning's light, the dewdrops gleam,
Nature wakes from a silken dream.
Birds take flight, a joyful tune,
As hope unfolds beneath the moon.

Each moment sparkles, bright and clear,
A canvas painted with love and cheer.
Embrace the day, let worries cease,
In every heartbeat, find your peace.""")
